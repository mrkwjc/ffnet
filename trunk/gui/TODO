1. Reorganize plots (where graph_plot should be?)
2. Network should have app attribute, how to deal with preview?
3. Training settings have to be rewritten
4. Needed tool for dumping network output

On Windows:
* figures are not visible?
* redirecting of output do not work
* PySide is needed for Qt? Qt not working
* Config button of figure toolbar do not appear
* Starting training is slow, training is memory hungry, especially for nproc>1, to much pickling i think.

Hints: plist should be defined in main app, app should not be an argument of Trainer?
