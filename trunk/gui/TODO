On Windows:
* all working processes should be created once at start, not at every training run, starting training is slow, training is memory hungry
* redirecting of output do not work
* autoscroll in logger not working on wx and qt

Major issues
* Make copyright and license notices in files and about dialog
* Make plots for outputs in recall and derivatives


Minor issues
* Better layered graph for imlgraph
* start and stop animations outside training thread. 
* Shared is only needed for training
* Make ffnetui icon more common in application (use custom View from main file)
