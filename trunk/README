Overview
--------
ffnet is a fast and easy-to-use feed-forward neural network 
training solution for python. For documentation and usage examples
go to http://ffnet.sourceforge.net or browse source distribution of 
the software.


Requirements
------------
ffnet needs python 2.4 or above and 'not too old'
(possibly the latest) versions of:
1. numpy/scipy (http://scipy.org/)
2. NetworkX (https://networkx.lanl.gov/wiki)

For plots (which apperar in examples) you will also need the
matplotlib package (http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/)


Download
--------
Go to http://ffnet.sourceforge.net to download latest release version
of ffnet. You can also download development version from ffnet
subversion repository:

svn co https://ffnet.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ffnet/trunk ffnet


Installation
------------
1. Building from source on Linux/Unix.
Unpack ffnet to the directory of your choice, enter this
directory and run:

    python setup.py install

ffnet uses numpy.distutils and f2py tool to compile Fortran parts of
the program. The above will work if you are running Linux/Unix system 
with gcc and g77 (gfortran). If you need to use specific Fortran 
compiler check for avilable options at:
http://cens.ioc.ee/projects/f2py2e/FAQ.html#q-what-are-supported-platforms-and-compilers
For example, installing with Intel Fortran looks like:

    python setup.py install --fcompiler=intel

2. Building from source on Windows.
If you have mingw compilers installed, run:

    python setup.py build --compiler=mingw32
	python setup.py install --skip-build

To install working mingw download:
http://downloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/MinGW-5.1.3.exe
and choose Candidate at installation time (Current doesn't work).
Don't forget to add mingw bin directory to PATH.

3. Binary installers for Windows:
Double click the installation program. Remember however that binaries
work only with specific software configuration indicated by installer
name.

Testing
-------
Installation can be tested with:

    from ffnet._tests import runtest
    runtest()

Execute also ffnet examples. They all should work.

Notes
-----
Windows users might be interested in installing Enthought Python:
http://code.enthought.com/downloads/enthon-python2.4-1.0.0.exe
which reaches most of the ffnet requirements: numpy/scipy, matplotlib, 
mingw compilers and contains also many other goodies. 
NetworkX however have to be installed separately.

It is also very convenient to run ffnet interactively with
ipython, an enhanced python shell. See http://ipython.scipy.org/moin.
