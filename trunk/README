Overview
--------
ffnet is meant to be an easy and fast feed-forward neural network 
training solution for python. Main parts of the project 
(propagation of the signal, gradient calculus with error 
backpropagation) are written in fortran 77 for computational speed.
Fast scipy optimization routines (also written in fortran) 
are used to minimize error of the network predictions. 
All steering is done using a python class. Usage of the trained
network is as simple as function call in python.

Unique features present in ffnet:
1. Any network connectivity without cycles is allowed; most 
   avilable software supports layered architecture only.
2. Training can be performed with use of several optimization 
   schemes including genetic alorithm based optimization.
3. There is access to exact partial derivatives of network outputs 
   vs. its inputs.
4. Automatic normalization of data; most software avilable 
   leaves this to the user.

Basic assumptions and limitations:
1. Network has feed-forward architecture.
2. Input units have identity activation function, 
   all other units have sigmoid activation function.
3. Provided data are automatically normalized, both input and output, 
   with a linear mapping to the range (0.15, 0.85).
   Each input and output is treated separately (i.e. linear map is 
   unique for each input and output).
4. Function minimized during training is a sum of squared errors 
   of each output for each training patterns.

ffnet uses some external open source software:
- networkx for handling network architecture as the graph data structure,
- numpy/scipy for training purposes,
- pikaia, genetic algorihm based oprimizer in fortran (included
  in this distribution).

Using ffnet software it's possible to:
- train/save/load/use feed-forward neural network in python,
- test new training algorithms for these type of networks,


Prerequisites
-------------
ffnet needs python version 2.3 or above and 'not too old' versions of:
1. numpy/scipy (http://scipy.org/)
2. NetworkX (https://networkx.lanl.gov/wiki)

For plots (which apperar in examples) you will also need the
matplotlib package (http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/)

Windows users may be interested in installing Enthought Python
edition (http://code.enthought.com/enthon) which includes numpy/scipy,
matplotlib and many other goodies. NetworkX however have to be 
installed separately.

It is also very convenient to run ffnet interactively with
ipython, an enhanced python shell. See http://ipython.scipy.org/moin.


Download
--------
Go to http://ffnet.sourceforge.net to download latest release version
of ffnet. You can also download development version from ffnet
subversion repository:

svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ffnet/trunk ffnet


Installation
------------
1. Building from source on Linux/Unix:
Unpack ffnet to the directory of your choice, enter this
directory and run:

python setup.py install

ffnet uses numpy.distutils and f2py tool to compile Fortran parts of
the program. The above will work if you are running Linux/Unix system 
with gcc and g77 (gfortran).
If you have need to use specific Fortran compiler check for avilable options at:
http://cens.ioc.ee/projects/f2py2e/FAQ.html#q-what-are-supported-platforms-and-compilers
For example, installing with Intel Fortran looks like:

python setup.py install --fcompiler=intel

2. Binary installer for Windows:
Double click the installation program.


Usage
-----
The basic usage is outlined below:

from ffnet import ffnet, mlgraph, savenet, loadnet
conec = mlgraph((2,2,1))
net = ffnet(conec)
input = [[0.,0.], [0.,1.], [1.,0.], [1.,1.]]
target  = [[1.], [0.], [0.], [1.]]
net.train_tnc(input, target, maxfun = 1000)
net.test(input, target, iprint = 2)
savenet(net, "xor.net")
net = loadnet("xor.net")
answer = net( [ 0., 0. ] )
partial_derivatives = net.derivative( [ 0., 0. ] )

Examples with full description can be found in examples directory
of source distribution.


Documentation
-------------
1. Go to http://ffnet.sourceforge.net for more info about ffnet.
2. Use docstrings of ffnet functions and methods.
